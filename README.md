# Portfolio

Professional portfolio developed with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, designed to showcase my skills as a web developer. Includes sections for personal introduction, featured projects, technical competencies, and contact information. Fully responsive, performance-optimized, and deployed on GitHub Pages.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
